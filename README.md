# Fair Restaurant Bill Splitter 🍽️💸

A simple, single-page HTML/JavaScript tool to fairly split a restaurant bill among friends, especially when some people had specific items or should contribute differently to the shared costs. No more awkward post-meal math struggles!

This tool defaults to a dark theme and allows toggling to a light theme, remembering your preference.

## Overview

This tool helps groups easily divide a restaurant bill when it's not a simple even split. It allows users to input the total bill (including tax & tip), the subtotal (before tax & tip), and then specify "adjustments" for individuals. An adjustment can be positive (if someone had an extra item they alone should pay for) or negative (if the group agrees someone should pay less towards shared items). The tool then calculates each person's fair share, proportionally distributing tax and tip.

It's designed to avoid a full itemized breakdown while still allowing for common scenarios where some individuals' costs differ from the rest of the group.

## A Note on Origins ("Vibe Coded" by AI) ✨

This project was generated by an AI (Google's Gemini) based on user prompts. You could say it was "vibe coded" – the AI took the general requirements and feeling of the problem and produced this solution. The original prompts are included below for full transparency and context.

### Initial User Prompt (Core Functionality)

> I have a coding problem for you. I need an HTML/JS single page that solves the following problem for people:
>
> I often go to restaurants with friends. We usually just have one person pay the bill, and others will Venmo that person. If we all share our food, it's easy to split. But if one or two people of 4 (or however many) get a drink, or some extra food, or maybe someones vegan, and the others aren't, then certain people in the group should be charged less.
>
> But I don't want to do a whole itemized breakdown, that takes too long. I should be able to just input maybe the total (including tip, tax, etc.), and then maybe the subtotal and the extra dollar amount that certain people should be accountable for (or not accountable for).
>
> Can you think about a solution to this problem, and make a single HTML website that solves it for me and others. I should be able to just input certain fields and the website will give me the breakdown per person.

### Second User Prompt (Dark Mode & Theme Persistence)

> Make it dark mode by default, but toggleable to the light mode you already designed. It can save the light/dark mode as a cookie so the browser remembers.
>
> _(AI Note: Implemented using `localStorage` for theme persistence, which is a modern alternative to cookies for this use case.)_

## Features

- **Easy Input:** Enter total bill, subtotal, and number of people.
- **Individual Adjustments:**
  - Assign positive adjustments for items an individual exclusively consumed.
  - Assign negative adjustments if an individual should contribute less to shared costs.
- **Proportional Tax & Tip:** Automatically calculates and distributes tax/tip based on each person's share of the subtotal.
- **Dark Mode by Default:** Starts with a comfortable dark theme.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between dark and light visual modes.
- **Theme Preference Saved:** Remembers your last selected theme using browser `localStorage`.
- **Clear Breakdown:** Shows each person's subtotal share, tax/tip share, and total amount owed.
- **Single HTML File:** No complex setup, just download and open in a browser.
- **Basic Validation:** Helps catch common input errors.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Get the `bill_splitter.html` (or whatever you named it) file.
2.  **Open:** Open the file in any modern web browser. It will default to dark mode.
3.  **Theme Toggle (Optional):** Use the "Switch to Light Mode" / "Switch to Dark Mode" button at the top right to change the theme. Your preference will be saved for your next visit.
4.  **Enter Bill Information:**
    - **Total Bill:** The final amount on the receipt (including tax & tip).
    - **Subtotal:** The bill amount _before_ tax and tip.
    - **Number of People:** Total people sharing the bill.
    - Click "**Next: Add People Details**".
5.  **Enter Individual Adjustments:**
    - For each person, you can optionally enter their name.
    - **Adjustment Amount (pre-tax/tip):**
      - **Positive (e.g., `15`):** For an item costing $15 (pre-tax) that this person alone is responsible for.
      - **Negative (e.g., `-5`):** If this person is to be credited $5 (pre-tax) from the shared costs. This amount is absorbed by the shared pool.
      - **Zero/Blank:** No specific adjustment for this person beyond their share of common costs.
6.  **Calculate:** Click the "**💸 Calculate Split**" button.
7.  **View Results:** The breakdown per person will be displayed, along with verification totals.

## How it Works (Calculation Logic)

1.  **Calculate Total Tax & Tip:** `Total Bill - Subtotal`.
2.  **Calculate Overall Tax & Tip Rate:** `Total Tax & Tip Amount / Subtotal`. (If subtotal is $0, the total bill is split evenly).
3.  **Sum of All Adjustments:** All individual positive and negative adjustments are summed.
4.  **Truly Shared Subtotal:** `Subtotal - Sum of All Adjustments`. This is the "pot" of money representing items/costs considered truly shared after accounting for individual-specific items or credits.
5.  **Shared Base Per Person:** `Truly Shared Subtotal / Number of People`.
6.  **Individual Subtotal:** For each person: `Shared Base Per Person + Their Specific Adjustment Amount`.
    - The tool checks if any person's resulting subtotal is negative and flags an error.
7.  **Individual Tax & Tip:** `Individual Subtotal * Overall Tax & Tip Rate`.
8.  **Individual Total Owed:** `Individual Subtotal + Individual Tax & Tip`.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (inline, with CSS Custom Properties for theming)
- JavaScript (vanilla, including `localStorage` for theme persistence)

## Contributing (Future Ideas)

This is a simple tool, but feel free to fork and improve! Some ideas:

- More sophisticated UI/UX.
- Ability to save/load previous bills.
- Option for itemized input as an advanced mode.
- Direct Venmo/payment link generation (ambitious!).
- Better handling of edge cases or more complex scenarios.

Pull requests are welcome!

Happy Splitting!
